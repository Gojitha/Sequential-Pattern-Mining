# Recognition of activities causing Hypoglycemia in Type-1 Diabetes patients using Sequence Pattern Mining


Hypoglycemia is a medical condition in which a person’s blood sugar levels drop below normal. It is a common complication of diabetes but can also occur in people without diabetes.

Symptoms of hypoglycemia can range from mild to severe and can include sweating, shaking, confusion, and even loss of consciousness. Severe hypoglycemia can be life-threatening if left untreated.

To better understand the patterns and risk factors associated with hypoglycemia, data mining techniques can be applied to large datasets of glucose monitoring data. These techniques can help identify frequent patterns of glucose readings that are associated with hypoglycemic events, as well as risk factors that increase the likelihood of a hypoglycemic episode.
